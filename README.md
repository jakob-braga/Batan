To host the server you must open the server.py, edit the self.server_ip on line 11 and change it to your computers IPV4 adress
from there just run the server.py to start it.

To get people to connect in the server_ip.txt, put the ip adress of the host in the first line and save it.

If you wish to play not just locally the host must be port forwarded.
